## Project Description
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women worldwide. In an attempt to identify factors that detect the presence of heart disease, this project aims to create a tool that can act as a supplement to the diagnostic process. Using binary classification predictive modeling, the objective is to detect and identify heart disease in individuals based on physical and medical characteristics. We focus on minimizing false negatives, as the consequence of a false negative is greater than the consequence of a false positive. To achieve this objective, we evaluate the available variables and models that will best contribute to business needs.
